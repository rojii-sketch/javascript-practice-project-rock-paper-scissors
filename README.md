# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

An interactive, web-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. This project was developed as part of my journey in mastering **JavaScript** and DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-time Scoring:** Tracks wins and losses during the session.
* **Interactive UI:** Built with clean HTML and responsive CSS.
* **Logic-based Gameplay:** Implements conditional logic to determine the winner against a randomized computer opponent.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling and layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Game logic, event listeners, and dynamic UI updates.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The main entry point.
* `style.css` - Visual styling.
* `script.js` - The engine behind the game logic.
